        ALL THE WORLD BEGAN WITH A YES. ONE MOLECULE SAID YES TO ANOTHER
        MOLECULE and life was born. But before prehistory there was the
        prehistory of prehistory and there was the never and there was the yes.
        It was ever so. I don’t know why, but I do know that the universe never
        began.
        <br />
        Make no mistake, I only achieve simplicity with enormous effort.
        <br />
        As long as I have questions and no answers I’ll keep on writing. How do
        you start at the beginning, if things happen before they happen? If
        before the pre-prehistory there were already the apocalyptic monsters?
        If this story doesn’t exist now, it will. Thinking is an act. Feeling is
        a fact. Put the two together — I am the one writing what I am writing.
        God is the world. Truth is always an interior and inexplicable contact.
        My truest life is unrecognizable, extremely interior and there is not a
        single word that defines it. My heart has emptied itself of every desire
        and been reduced to its own final or primary beat. The toothache that
        runs through this story has given me a sharp stab in the middle of our
        mouth. So high-pitched I sing a strident and syncopated melody — it’s my
        own pain, I who carry the world and there is a lack of happiness.
        Happiness? I never saw a dumber word, invented by all those northeastern
        girls out there...
